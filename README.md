# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---
In this C++ project, I use a Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller, or PID for short, in order to drive a simulated car around a virtual track. The project involves implementing the controller primarily for the steering angle of the car (although I used the value from this controller to also determine throttle), as well as tuning coefficients for each PID value in order to calculate a steering angle that keeps the car on the track.

Project Steps
Implement PID Controller for Steering (optional: controlling throttle as well)

Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
The P - "proportional", component had the most directly observable effect on the car's behavior. It causes the car to steer proportional (and opposite) to the car's distance from the lane center (which is the CTE) - if the car is far to the right it steers hard to the left, if it's slightly to the left it steers slightly to the right.

The D - "differential", component counteracts the P component's tendency to ring and overshoot the center line. A properly tuned D parameter will cause the car to approach the center line smoothly without ringing.

The I - "integral", component counteracts a bias in the CTE which prevents the P-D controller from reaching the center line. This bias can take several forms, such as a steering drift (as in the Control unit lessons), but I believe that in this particular implementation the I component particularly serves to reduce the CTE around curves.


### Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
Optimize init parameters for each PID coefficient

Although it is removed from the final code, I had used Twiddle a little bit to try out different parameters, but found the values found in the original project lessons to be sufficient under my current implementation. I had also used an approach with SGD (stochastic gradient descent) before, but that did not seem to perform as well as Twiddle. I ended up deciding against Twiddle as the results tended to vary greatly - one build of my PID Controller, in a test of 10 runs around the track, made it around six times, half of which were very slow, with the others (using a throttle fully based on steering angle instead of the measured approach I use now with a percentage of steering + a set value) limiting to race around the track at 50mph. Unfortunately, there were also three runs ending with crashes, two of which even happened before the first curve. Part of this was due to noise/variance in the simulator itself, from the looks of it.

In the end, the final values were determined by manual tuning. The ratio of the coefficients to each other that I chose (0.2, 0.004, 3.0) for determining  steer value and  (0.316731, 0.0, 0.0226185) for determining throttle seemed to work well, and I also tried lowering & raising them in conjunction with each other as well as tuning each individually. I typically found that I was creating too high of steering angles (causing crashes if the speed had gotten too high on a straight) by raising them in conjunction with each other, while lowering all of them together meant the car struggled on the larger curves, sometimes not turning enough and shooting off the track. Also i was controlling the car throttle based on the cars speed , if the car speed exceeds speed limit (50mph) then reduce the throttle value to 0.2. Which helped the car in maintaining constant speed.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
